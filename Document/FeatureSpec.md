## Scenario Description
Oringinally our client is planned using ReactJS, but its somewhat hard to use, no one likes it, and we have little or no progress, therefore we need some ground-breaking changes, by develop two version of client once, for minimize the risk

## Feature Description
Sections of the project:

1. Framework Selection:
    For the framework, we wanted a framework that's easy to use and shorten developemnt cycle, and runs on all platform with single codebase. So Flutter is the best choose, and set up an enviornment and repo to began development.
